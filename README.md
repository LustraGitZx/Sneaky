# Sneaky
![alt text](https://github.com/LustraGitZx/Sneaky//blob/main/Header.jpg?raw=true)
It's simple project that i made for fun, it's just a sneaky game. I was making this project for NW.js, but that i decided that it's pointles, cos NW.js is about 200+ mb so it makes to destribut the game more difficult.
